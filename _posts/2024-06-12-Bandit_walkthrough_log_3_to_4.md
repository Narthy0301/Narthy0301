We can see that using the ls command does not look up any files.

In this case we should use "option"

```
ls + -al
-l : Print out in detail when listing files.
-a : List all files in the path (including hidden files)
```

We can see hidden file named "...Hiding-From-You"

```
cat ...Hiding-From-You
```
