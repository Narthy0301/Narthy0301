```

- Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14**. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. **Note:** **localhost** is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

After we login, we can find somekind of code named sshkey.private. This is gonna be a hint for next level. 

```
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220
yes
```

*The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol *sets up encrypted connections for remote logins and file transfers between computers*.

Through this command(ssh -i) we can try to connect with ssh(for this connection, we need ssh key code ! This is why we use sshkey.private file)

Then enter "yes" on the terminal
